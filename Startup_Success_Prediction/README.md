# Startup Success Prediction (Machine Learning)

 Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a startup will be successful based on key features such as funding amount, industry, founding team, and growth metrics. The goal was to build a classification model that provides probabilistic predictions of startup outcomes.
